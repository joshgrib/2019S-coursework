* P-cards go to treasurers or president
* Purchase order number has to be generated before a purchase is made
  * Seems like this is more for vendors/contracts
* Purchase request form submitted within 24hrs of purchase
* Receipts ideally in PDF, jpeg is fine, png is not
* Budget open March 24th
  * Due April 6th

* One email reminder for missing receipts if it's not within 72hrs, 24hrs to respond
  * If you don't comply then no purchases for 2 weeks
