## Seasonality
* Need to do revenue forcasting - so you need to know if there will be periodic sales cycles

## Credit card tokenization
* We want to store credit card info, but it can't just be plaintext
* Solutions
  * Encrypt it - but then you need to worry about PCI compliance which is super annoying
  * Get a token from a 3rd party - let them worry about compliance and then you just store the tokens that you get from them
    * You can even get tokens with the last 4 digits of the card number
* Verification number (CVV) doesn't need to be stored at all
    * This is only used to check if the name and address match the record of the cardholder

### Fraud
* CC fraud using someone elses card
* Phishing to get user credentials
* Return fraud
    * Wardrobing - using an item and then returning it
    * Return items with fraudulent cards
    * Cross-merchant to receipt - buy online and claim you didn't recieve it, then return the item in a different store
* Criminal re-shipper
    * Trick someone into letting you ship stuff to their address using a stolen credit card, and have the person send the packages to you. Then if the charge comes up as fraud they go to the other person because they ordered the items

#### Battling Fraud
* Changing the level of strictness for credit card authorization (if name/address matches CVV)
* Buy synonym/misspelled domain names to make phishing harder
* Educate customers - personalize emails with info phishers don't have and tell the user something like "We will always include the following information in our emails to you"
* Use SSL
* Spear phishing - best combatted by policy and education for employees

## Homework
* Register for Google WebMaster tools
* Add code snippet for analytics to the page
* Set up basic A/B testing
* Under "Content Experiements" be sure to enable "Distribute traffic evenly across all variants"
* **Projects due May 6th**
