## "Mom & pop" vs Enterprise
Many different concerns, strengths, weaknesses, etc

## Scaling
* Vertical - add better hardware so the machines you have can do more
* Horizontal - add more machines to handle a larger workload
* Distributed - use more locations to reduce the travel distance

### Technology
* Query optimization
  * Biggest scaling concern is usually databases
* Re-platforming to get a clean slate for tech debt
* Caching
  * Comes with some concerns, but is a quick and easy way to boost performance in many cases

## Disaster Recovery
Important to plan for so you have the correct redundancy, availability zones, etc
AWS is generally really good at handling failures/outages

## Final Project
* Hosted wherever you want
* Must have:
  * Home page
  * Category page
  * Product page
  * Shopping cart page
  * Checkout page (not actually charging anyone)
  * Order confirmation page
  * Google Analytics Reporting
  * A/B testing
  * SEO
  * Google AdWords campaign
* Due at the end of April
