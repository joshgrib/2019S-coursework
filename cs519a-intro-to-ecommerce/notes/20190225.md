## Content Injection
* Caching can help speed up page load, but it sends the same response for every user
* Use AJAX for personalized content
  * Avoids a full page reload
  * Enables "infinite scrolling" by loading more content as you go through it
  * CORS can be an issue depending on where you're pulling data from
  * Pros
    * Better UX - faster initial page load
    * Performance - offload work from the web server
  * Cons
    * Can affect SEO/analytics if you go toward an SPA approach without care
      * SPA can also mess up a generate sitemap

## Multi-channel Retailing
* Selling across more than one channel (online, catalog, physical stores)
* Benefits
  * Access to new markets
  * Customer reach/penetration
  * Customer satisfactional/loyalty
    * Order online, return in-store (offers opportunity to sell something else)
  * Inventory optimization/clearance
* Challenges
  * Integation between different systems
  * Inventory allocation/fulfillment (within distribution center)
  * Operational difficulties - different things are needed for running each channel
  * Pricing consistency
    * It costs more to have a store in Times Square - stuff needs to cost more to compensate, but users expect the same prices online and in-store
  * Brand consistency - the website should "feel" like the store

## Brand consistency
* UX
* Pricing
  * MSRP - manufacturer suggested retail price
  * MAP - minimum advertised prices (biggest sale allowed)
    * The sale can actually be for a lower price, but it can't be advertised. If it shows up in a browser it counts at advertising, but an item in a user's cart can be priced lower
  * MRP - maximum retail price, mainly in India, a limit on the maximum sale price
* Customer service
* Tax
  * Some systems calculat tax based on where the order or return happened, so you could buy something and deliver it to one place, then return it somewhere else and get more money back
* Shipping - some companies treat the brick-and-mortar store as a mini distribution center, so you might get an online order shipped from your local brick-and-mortar store to get it quicker

## Data consistency/single-customer-view
* A user should have one "profile" across all channels
* Strategies
  * Master/slave pattern where the core "profiles" are stored in one place and other systems get updates from the main one
  * Pub-sub architecture
  * Data sync process to merge/update/etc

## Traffic Sources

### Affiliates
* Commission for referrals
* Needs to be managed - usually with tracking pixels and cookies
  * Tracking pixel - `<img src="http://www.site.com/images/1x1.png?name=productId&value=1234" />`
    * Requests can be tracked by the site or the affiliate to figure out what the invoice should be
* You don't want to overdo it because then you might encourage users to find the best affiliate links, lowering the profit margins

### Comparison shopping engines
* Kayak
* Google shopping
* Shopzilla
* Nextag

### Paid search
* Ads on a search engine

### Measurement of effectiveness
> Where should I spend my ad budget?
* Cost per click (CPC) - cost for a site visit
* Cost per acquisition (CPA) - cost to get a new customer
* Click through rate (CTR) - how many people that see the ad actually go to the site
* Conversion rate (CR) - how many people that go to a page on the site actually buy something
* Number of clicks/impressions - how many people see the ad

All of the above are "midstream" metrics - they're ok but not great

#### Return on Ad Spend (ROAS)
How much revenue do you get for each dollar spent on each channel?

$$\frac{((Impressions * CTR * CR * \mu (sale)) - Campaign Cost)}{Campaign Cost}$$

This can get more complicated depending on how you want to tune the equation

ROAS values
* 1 - doubling your investment
* 0 - breaking even
* -1 - losing money
  * Negative can be ok depending on what your goals are - think Uber losing money on every trip - in that case it's about gaining market share quickly
