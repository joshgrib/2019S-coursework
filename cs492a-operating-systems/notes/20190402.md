## Memory Management

### Why do we need memory abstraction?
* The program just sees the memory addresses, but it needs to be limited so it can't access the OS/BIOS memory
  * Some OSes put the OS/BIOS memory at the beginning of the available memory addresses and start programs "on top" of that, while others cut off the tail of the available memory for OS/BIOS use and then allows programs to use the space up to that
* We are limited by the total amount of RAM, and it needs to be allocated between the programs

### Relocation
* Programs are compiled with JMP statements to go to specific addresses, but the address changes when it get's loaded into memory
* When a program is *relocatable* it can be placed and run at any memory address
  * This is a concern for the compiler, solved by adding extra information in the executable
  * The *loader* decides where to place a program in memory, and either:
    * Changes the addresses to match the placement using an offset through the *linker*
    * Uses a specially compiled program that doesn't need the addresses to be relocated
      * *PIC* - positionally independent code
      * This is what many low-level libraries like `libc` do

#### Problems with relocation
* No protection between different applications
* Relocation can be expensive

### Address Space
* A way to provide a program with a block of memory while keeping it isolated from other programs
* This is similar to how a process abstracts upon the CPU to allow multiple programs to use it

#### Base and Limit Registers
* *Partitions* are created in the RAM to create different address spaces
* *Base register* stored the offset to the beginning of the address space, then dynamically offsets any memory references in the program
* *Limit register* stores the size of the address space to make sure programs don't overrun their partition

### Swapping
> What happens when you have a lot of programs running and they don't all fit in memory
* *Swapping* entails:
  * Bring a process in entirety into memory
  * Run for a while
  * Put it back on disk memory

#### Memory fragmentation
* If many swaps happen, you might be a bad layout with only small chunks of free space that don't provide enough continuous space for a program
* *Memory compaction* basically "bumps" all the address spaces to one end of the memory to clear up some larger chunks
  * This can be really expensive

### Bitmap memory management
* A bitmap is created where each bit represents an *allocation unit*, and the value shows in that memory is being used
* Bitmap is scanned until a large enough block for the new program is found
* **Problem**: if the allocation unit is too small it takes a long time to find an open space, if it's too large then it's not granular enough to be useful

#### Linked list memory management
* To solve the bitmap problems, a linked list can be used to avoid scanning over the whole bitmap
* Linked list has elements for programs and holes, with the start and end pointers for the addresses
  * As a sorted linked list it's easy to maintain the minimal amount of entries in the list

### Large programs and overlays
* What if the program is so big it need more memory than the hardware can provide?
* Only part of a program is loaded at a time
* The *overlay manager* is a required part of the program (*not the OS*) to do this
  * It's responsible for loading and unloading overlay segments as they are needed
  * One root sement is always in RAM, including the overlay manager. Multiple overlays can then be created and segments of different overlay levels can be loaded and unloaded as they are needed
* **Problem**: complicated for implementation because the OS doesn't provide it

### Problem with programs on physical memory
* Protection
* Relocation - base + limit registers
* Fitting multiple programs - swapping
* Memory fragmentation - compaction/management, but it's very expensive
* App larger than memory - overlay manager, but it's expensive, difficult, not an OS solution, and very complicated

### Virtual memory - the solution to all physical memory problems
* Fotheringham 1961 - decouples address space from physical memory, give the illusion of a large and private address space regardless of the physical memory size
* Each process gets a *virtual address space*
  * Virtual memory is usually larger
  * Virtual addresses are translated to a physical address
  * Virtual address space is broken into *chunks* which are a contiguous range of addresses in both virtual and physical memory
    * Not all chunks are needed to run the program, chunk switching is hidden from the process
    * If a chunk that is not loaded in references the OS loads it from the disk and re-executes it
  * Implemented in the OS and the hardware

#### Paging
> There is also a technique called *segmentation* that isn't used much anymore
* One dimensional address space - what every 64 bit processor uses
* Virtual address space has fixed-size units called *pages*
  * Corresponding units in physical memory are called *page frames*
  * Pages and page frames are the same size - usually 4kB, but it can go higher (up to 1GB has been done)
    * 4kb page size w/ 64kb virtual space and 32kb physical would get 16 pages and 8 page frames
* Hardware *MMU (Memory management unit)* does the mapping from pages to page frames
* The app thinks it has a large private address space starting at 0x00 to going up to $2^P-1$ bytes
  * $P$ is <= the # of bits in a pointer (e.g. 64 bits)
* Virtual pages can be scattered across physical memory - fragmentation isn't an issue

##### Hardware
* CPU sends a virtual address to the MMU, MMU responds with a physical address
