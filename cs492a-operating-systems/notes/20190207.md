## `gcc` compilation
For threaded programs you need the `-pthread` flag: `gcc -pthread -o prog prog.c

The pthread library changed from what's in the book, now you need to call `pthread_join` on each thread at the end of the program

## Process Table
* Consists of multiple entries
* One entry per process (Process Control Block)

### Thread Control Block
* Similar to the PCB, but the TCB is for managing threads
* Includes pointers to the code, and values for the stack
  * Because they use the same code, they could run the same or different parts of the program at the same time, potentially with different execution states, resulting in different outcomes
