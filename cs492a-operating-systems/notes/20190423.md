# Input/Output

## Housekeeping
* Final May 10th
  * Probably starting 9:30
  * Should be 1.5 hours max
  * Likely similar to the midterm
* Homework 3
  * Due tomorrow
* Homework 4
  * Released soon
  * Smaller - only a week long, maybe 6-7 hours
* No more quizzes
* Next week is the final review

## What does it do?
* **Controls** the computer's IO devices
* **Provides an interface** between the devices and the software

I/O devices operate on a wide range of speeds
* Software has to be able to handle the varying speeds
* Different hardware busses connect different peripherals
  * Different busses also have different speeds

## I/O Ports
* Used to move data to/from a device and a CPU register
* These instructions are privileged (can only be run in kernel space)

## Direct Memory Access (DMA)
* Requires a **DMA Controller** - either on the device or the motherboard
* Contains registers that are used to control
  * Direction of transfer
  * Transfer unit
  * Byte burst size
* DMA controller talks to device controllers and tells them where to send data in some space of addresses in memory, also receiving confirmations which are used to send interrupts to the CPU
* Can either handle one or multiple transfers at a time (*multiple channels*)
* Different algorithms to choose what requests to serve next - round robin/etc

### Data Transfer Bus Modes
* *Word-at-a-time mode*
  * DMA controller requests to transfer one word at a time
  * CPU is interrupted a little bit at a time - also called *cycle stealing*
* *Block mode*
  * Get the bus then send a bunch of trasnfers at once - also called *burst mode*
  * Takes the bus from the CPU for longer, but will transfer faster

### DMA Controller Modes
* *Fly-by mode* - DMA controller tells device directly where to transfer data to
* *Flow-through mode* - DMA controller is the intermediary that receives data and knows where to put it
  * More expensive computationally, but more flexible

## Example
* 5-channel DMA controller
* Request or receive a 32-bit word every 50 nanoseconds
* How fast does the bus need to be to avoid a bottleneck

4 bytes(32 bits) takes 100 nanoseconds to fulfill a request
40 MB/s is the minimum speed to avoid bottlenecks
