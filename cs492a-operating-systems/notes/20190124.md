## Housekeeping
* CA Office hours
  * David W 3-5
  * Thomas R 4-6
* Individual lab assignments due the day after the "lab class", but should ideally be finished before the class
  * The work needs to be in a git repo
* First team assignments
  * 2 weeks to complete
  * Teams of 2
  * You can work alone if you want but it's graded as if it's two people, not recommended
  * Also using a git repo
* Midterm review March 12th

## OS Concepts

### Processes
*Processes* use *address spaces* and have access to *files* with some level of *protection*. A process can also write to a standard output file which is displayed in the *shell*.

### Address Space
* Range of addresses in memory
* Can be read/written/executed

### Files
* Container for data
* Have permissions
* Grouped in *directories*
* I/O devices are *mounted* to a directory

### Input/Output
* Keyboard, monitor, printer, network card, etc
* OS manages the IO subsystem and device drivers

### Protection (or Isolation)
* Confidentiality, security, attacks
* Spectre/meltdown use hardware vulberabilities to access memory from other processes

### The Shell
Basic shell
```sh
#define TRUE 1
while (TRUE) {
  type_prompt();
  read_command(command, parameters);

  if(fork() != 0) {
    waitpid(-1, &status, 0);
  } else {
    execve(command, parameters, 0);
  }
}
```

Read inputs, execute commands, print output

## OS Structure
* Monolithic - on big kernel
  * UNIX
  * Linux
* Microkernal - split up
  * Minix
  * Mac
  * Fuschia
* Hybrid
  * Windows

## CPU
* Brain of the computer
  * Fetches and executes instructions from memory
* Each CPU has a specific set of intructions
  * x86 and ARM have different interfaces
* CPU registers
  * General
  * Program counter
  * Stack pointer
  * Program status word
    * Lets you know if you're in kernel or user space
  * Sometimes others too!
* Code execution
  * 3 stage pipeline - fetch/decode/execute
  * Superscalar CPUs have several fetch/decode pipelines that feed a central holding buffer, which in turn feeds several execution units
    * Out-of-order execution, compared to a single pipeline which has in-order execution

## Cache layers
* Registers
* Cache
  * L1
  * L2
  * L3
* Memory
* Disk
  * SSD
  * HDD
* Network
  * Local cache
  * Remote cache
  * Remote resource
* Tape

### CPU Cores
* Quad-core chip
