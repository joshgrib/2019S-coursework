# Disks

## Housekeeping
* Next class is a *large* review with a lot of slides
* Final format
  * 10 exercises
    * 5 small questions from the first half of the course - one line answers like "What's the difference between a process and a thread"
    * 5 exercises - similat to the questions from quizzes or homeworks

## Persistent storage technology
* Magentic disks - HDD, floppy disk
  * Moving parts
  * Read and write are equally fast
* Solid-state drive - SSB, USB drives
  * No moving parts
  * Reads are *faster* than writes
* Optical disks - DVD, Blru-ray
  * Moving parts
  * Write-once, read multiple time - writing is slower than reading
  * Not used much anymore

## Redudant array of independent disks (RAID)
* **On the final definitely**
* A way to store data across multiple disks, ideally for performance gains and data integrity

### RAID 0
* Also called *striping*
* Data is *striped* across disks
* No redundency - data is striped across disks
  * Multiple strips can be fetched in parallel
  * One disk failure means everything is lost

### RAID 3
* Extra disk used to store parity bits

### RAID 4

### RAiD 5
* Interleaved partiy/checck blocks

### RAID 6

## Error handling

## Stable storage
