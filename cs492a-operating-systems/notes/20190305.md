# Synchronization Problems

## Housekeeping
* Midterm
  * Review next week on Tuesday
  * About 5 exercises - similar to the quizzes, scheduling exercise, questions about processes
* HW2 posted today, due next week before midterm

## Dining philosophers
By Dijkstra 1965
* 5 philosophers, each have a plate and one fork, and need 2 forks to eat
* If each takes the one of their left then they all wait indefinitely for a second fork

Also a Chinese version with lawyers and chopsticks

## Resources
Basic qequence of events:
1. Request the resource
2. Do some operatings
3. Release the resource

In semaphores we use `down()` to take a resource and `up()` to release it

## Deadlock/starvation
* **Deadlock** is each entity waiting for something a different entity has, as a result of resource sharing
* **Happy scheduling** is when the potential for deadlock is avoided by chance
* **Starvation** is when one or more processes are blocked from gaining access to a resource
  * Deadlock is a special form where every process is in starvation

## Deadlock modeling
System Model
* Resource types/classes ($m$)

### Resource allocation graph
* Set of vertices $V$ and edges $E$
* $V$ partitioned into two types
  * **Process vertices** $P=\{P_1, P_2, ..., P_n\}$
  * **Resource vertices** $P=\{R_1, R_2, ..., R_n\}$
* Graphically
  * Process nodes are circles
  * Resources are boxes, with boxes inside to denote how many instances of the resource there are - e.g. a box with 4 boxes could be a set of 4 printers in a print queue
  * Request has a arrow from the process to the resource
    * Assignment goes the other way
  * **Cycles** are required for a deadlock, but do not always result in one

## How to deal with deadlock
* Ostrich algorithm - pretend there isn't any problemm
  * Reasonable if deadlocks are rare and prevention cost is high - many operating systems do this and leave it up to the programmer to avoid
  * Trade-off between convenience and correctness
* Detection and recovery
  * Allow deaddlock to happen, but use a detection algorithm and recovery scheme
  * Detection
    * Graph analysis w/ some cycle detection algorithm
      * No cycle = no deadlock
      * Cycle
        * Only one instance per resource type = deadlock
        * Several instances per resource type = potentially deadlock
          * Matrix algorithm
  * Recovery
    * Preemption
    * Rollback
    * Killing processes
