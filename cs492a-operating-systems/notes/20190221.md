* Github classroom is up now
  * classroom.github.com/a/AZBOIxDE

* Processes need to communicate to share information or coordinate
* Example - ATM transactions could be on different threads, but they need to communicate about what the balance is and who's doing transactions


> Basically covering race conditions and deadlocks with threads
> * Peterson's Solution to the critical section
