# Virtual Memory Paging: Page Replacement Algorithms

## Page Replacement Algorithms
> First group homework is to implement a page replacement algorithm
**Context**
* Load a new program
* Program requests more memory
* Page fault occurs - *Need a free page frame* to load into from disk
  * Occurs because only part of the application is actually loaded in memory
* If there's no free page frames, we need to move one onto the disk
  * **But which one do we pick?** - topic of today's lecture
    * With the goal of *lowering the chance of future page faults*

**Input** - a string of memory references, which is a list of pages that the program wants to reference in order
  * Example: "1,2,3,4,1,2,5,..." - if the memory is 0x0100 it's page one, 0x1425 is page 2 (if each page is 0x0000-0x1000, 0x1000-0x2000, etc)

### Optimal Algorithm (OPT)
* What's the best we can possibly do assuming the OS knows about the future usage
  * Replace the page used farthest in the future
* Can be estimated by logging usage from previous runs, but this isn't very practical
* It's a nice idea but doesn't work in real systems

#### Example
* 3 physical page frames - only 3 pages can be used at a time
* 8 virtual pages - input string can only contain 0-7
* How many faults?
  * Go through the input string and start filling physical page frames
  * Each time an empty page is initially filled that's a page fault
  * Any time you need to swap one out that's a page fault
    * To swap, look at the virtual pages that are physically loaded and see which is used furthest away

### So what works then?
* **Recall** that a page table entry includes bits to keep track of page usage - if it's referenced or modified
  * R is set when the page is referenced(read/write), M is set when the page is modified(only write)

#### Not Recently Used (NRU)
* Idea
  * Use the tracking bits to figure out what pages haven't been recently accessed
  * It's better to replace a page that 
* Algorithm
  * OS clears all page tracking bits when the program starts
  * Periodically clear the R bit to keep track of *recent* usage
  * When there's a fault you look at the four categories
    0. not referenced, not modified
    1. not referenced,     modified
    2.     referenced, not modified
    3.     referenced,     modified
  * Remove an entry from the lowest-numbered non-empty bucket

#### FIFO
* First-in, first-out
* Trivial implementation, but doesn't consider actual page usage
* Algorithm
  * Maintain a linked-list of pages, added in the order they are loaded into memory
  * When there's a fault you remove the page that's been in memory the longest
* This falls victim to *Belady's Anomaly* - when more page frames can lead to more page faults

#### Second Change
* Variant on FIFO that takes usage into account
* Algorithm
  * Look at pages in FIFO order
  * Check reference bit
    * If 0 - remove page, add new page to the end of the list with R=0
    * If 1 - set to 0 and move to the end of the list (this is the second chance), then add the new page to the end of the list with R=0
  * If there aren't enough replacements on the first pass, then we fallback to pure FIFO

#### Clock
> **This is the one we're doing for the homework**
* Variant on second chance
  * People were concerned about the cost of the dequeue and enqueue
  * Instead a circular buffer is used, and a single pointer is moved (the hand of the clock) to keep track of the next frame to use

#### Least Recently Used (LRU)
* Good approx of the optimal algorithm based on the observations:
  * Pages that have been used recently will continue to be used
  * Pagees that haven't been used recently will continue to not be used
* Assumes that program has good memory reference locality
* Optimal looks at the future, while LRU looks at the past
* Implementation
  * Priority list via double linked list
  * Most recent is at the front, least at the read
  * Always remove the page from the end to free up
  * The newly referenced page is moved to the front
* Costly because you have to move a bunch of pointers every time a page is used

##### With help from hardware
* Counter implementation
  * The hardware has a counter
  * Every instruction that references memory increases the counter
  * Each page table entry stores the counter value at the time it gets referenced
  * To evict a page you choose the one with the lowest counter
* Still not great because you have to scan every page before making a decision

#### Not Frequently Used (NFU)
* Variation of LRU
  * Most machines don't have the hardware for the counter, so it's simulated
* The problem - this assumed the page usage is fairly consistent in the program, but in actuality the program more go between states that used different sets of apges

#### Aging
* Use the counter, but periodically reduce the counter values
  * Shift counter right to divide by 2, then add the R value to the leftmost bit, weighing recently referenced pages more heavily
