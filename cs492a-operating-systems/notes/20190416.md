# File System

## Requirements for long-term info storage
* Possible to store a large amount of information
* Information must persist after the process terminates
* Multiple processes must be able to access the information concurrently

### Devices
* Mechnanical rotating disk
* Solid state drive
* Tapes

The disk can be thought of as a linear sequence of fixed-size blocks that can be read and written
* Operations are in terms of *blocks* that are loaded into memory - not individual bits/bytes
  * Blocks are used independently of file size - if a file uses a part of a block it reserves the whole block

### Questions
* How to find information?
* How to isolate info between users for security?
* How to know what blocks are free?

## Files
* **Files** are abstractions on the disk so the user doesn't need to worry about the details of storage
  * Process abstracts CPU
  * Address space abstracts memory
  * File abstracts disk
* **File system** is an OS subsystem for managing files
* Initially files only had 8 bytes for the name and 3 for the extension - hence all the three letter file extensions
* Upper/lower case distinction - unix treats them as different names but Windows does not
* Linux generally doesn't care about the extension - the user needs to say what program to open it with, while Windows associates extensions with certain programs

### File structure
* Files can be structured in different ways
  * *Note:* not really true anymore - files are pretty much always a series of bytes (unstructured - you can put whatever you want inside and the user is responsible for the format)
  * Could also be structured as a series of *records* where each record has 80 characters, or as a tree - usually for mainframes

### Types of files
* Regular files - user information, ASCII, binary, etc
* Directory files - store the structure of the file system, usually just listing the files in the directory and metadata
* Character special files - model serial IO
* Block special files - model disk

## Directories
### Directory operations
* Create (`.`, `..`)
* Delete
* Open
* Close
* Read
* Rename
* Link (hard, soft)
* Unlink

## File system subsystem internals
* Store open-file-tables per-process and system-wide

### Types of fragmentation
* External - unused blocks that are gaps between contiguous files
* Internal - unused space within a block when a file doesn't fit perfectly into the block size

### Disk and file system layout
* Disk can be divided into partitions

#### Contiguous allocation
* Each file occupies a set of contiguous blocks
* Blocks are used independently of file size - this can cause *disk fragmentation*
* **Pros**
  * Simple - only need to know the starting block and the amount of blocks used by each file
  * Performant - entire file can be read in a single operation
* **Cons**
  * Wastes space - external fragmentation between files may need compaction
  * Files cannot grow - you need to know the largest potential file size upfront
* A *logical address* is local inside a file, and can be located with a block number and block offset

#### Linked-list allocation
* Each file is a linked list of blocks
* Blocks can be scattered anywhere on the disk
* Each block has data and a pointer to the next block
* Avoid external fragmentstion
