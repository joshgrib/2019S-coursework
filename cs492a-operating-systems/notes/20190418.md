# File Systems Continued

## Housekeeping
**Last quiz next Tuesday on File Systems**
Check out the example with indirections to calculate max file size

## Index Allocation
> Problem - linked list with table could have the table get too big, with i-nodes you can store smaller tables to minimize the overhead of individuald reads, the linked list solution also involves a lot of disk accesses to get each block Additionally, the table needs to be stored in memory, so it must be relatively small compared to available memory
* *i-nodes*(index nodes) are used to store locations of blocks that make up a file
* *index table* is used to store block offsets of indexes

### Indirection
The location in the i-node table could point to a location within another i-node table, recursively

**Indirection** is an issue where something ends up far down in the reference tree

*i-nodes* can contain pointers to:
* Direct blocks
* Single indirect block
* Double indirect blocks
* etc

## Directories - File names
For a while, file entries had limited space to store names, to fix this the directory entry can just have pointers to another location that stores the name of the file

### Hard linking files
A file could be referenced in multiple directories while only actually storing the file once

### Symbolic (soft) linking files
This is a special link that basically stores the path to the other file. This means the owner keeps ultimate control over the file, but it has extra overhead to parse the path and locate the file

## Virtual File System
Once machine could contain multiple file systems in use at one time - the disk could use one system while a USB stick would use a different one, but the user would interface with them the same way.

The *virtual file system* is a way to abstract away the different file systems.
