## Professor
* Antonio Barbalace - abarbala@stevens.edu
* http://www.cs.stevens.edu/~abarbala
* Office hours Tuesday 4:30-6:30 NB 204

### CAs
* Thomas Pyle
* David Sevilla

## Objectives
* Intro to basic components of operating systems
  * Process/thread management
  * Memory management
  * I/O
  * File system
* Advanced topics
  * Linux internals

## Outcomes
### First half
* Process-to-OS communication
* Multi-thread programming
* Syschronization
### Second half
* Virtual memory abstraction
* I/O abstraction
* File system algorithmms

## Important points
* Ask questions whenever - class, breaks, office hours, email
  * If HW is too long or wrong, to clarify a topic
* Course modified significantly from previous years - some stuff replaced but roughly the same material
* Lectures may not follow the textbook closely
* Lecture notes on canvas before class
  * Parts will be blank and filled in during class

## Schedule
* Two labs, two HWs, midterm, spring break, two team assignments, final
  * Lab assignment is something to do on a linux VM - plenty of time to do, due by spring break to show CA in class and then submit
  * Teams(2 people) for team assignments determined before spring break

## Grading
* Quizzes(4) - 6% - for attendance
* Individual labs(2) - 12%
* Homeworks(2) - 12%
* Team assignments(2) - 20%
* Midterm - 25%
* Final - 25%
  * Optional if you have over 90%
* Extra credit projects - 5%

### Policies
* In class labs - bring laptops
* Assignments - no collaboration
* Late submissions get -25% for every day late, not more than 90% off

## What is an OS?
* Modern computer has processors, memory, disks, IO devices
  * Managing these components requires a layer of software called the *operating systems*
* OS sits between the hardware and the software - the user usually uses an interface for the program, which in turn interacts with the operating system
  * *System software* is everything between the application and hardware - from compiler/runtime through the OS and to the hypervisor

### Functions
* Extended machine - top-down view
  > OSs turn ugle hardware in beautiful abstractions
* Resource manager - bottom-up view
  * Allow multiple processes to run at the same time

### Modes
* *User mode* runs application, compiler, runtime, UI, and core runtime libraries
* *Kernel mode* runs kernel and hypervisor code

## Types of computers
* Mainframes
  * Puts CPU/memory in one machine and IO/devices in another one
* Servers
* Workstation/desktop
* Laptop
* Tablet
* Mobile
* Embedded

## History
* 1945-1955: Vacuum tubes
* 1955-1965: Transistors and batch systems
* 1067-1980: ICs and Multiprogramming
* 1980-1990: Personal computers
* 1990-Present: Mobile computers

## Pre-OS
* ENIAC 1943
  * Big calculator
  * Programmed by moving cable connections
* IBM OS/360 for mid-ranged and large companies
  * Needed an OS - Multics is first OS with security and hierarchical file system
  * Multics spawned UNIX from Thompson and Ritchie
* Minicomputers - 1980+
  * Personal computers, initially limited hardware but eventually became more powerful
    * OS starts as subroutine library but expands out to include everything we now consider part of the OS
  * MSDOS = MicroSoft Disc Operating System
  * Rise of personal computers brings the graphical user interface
* Mobile era - Android and iOS, more powerful and user-friendly embedded systems(Raspberry Pi, Arduino)
