## How CPU communicates with I/O devices
* CPU reads a work from memory or I/O port
  1. CPU puts the address it needs on the bus' address lines
  2. CPU sends READ signal on bus' control line
  3. Second signal line 

## Offloaded Communication
DMA controller manages data transfer for the CPU

## Processing Interrupts
* CPU "checks" for interrupts after every instruction
* If there's an interrupt the CPU looks it up in an *interrupt vector* which returns a new program counter
* This program counter is the *interrupt handler*, or interrupt service routine(ISR)
* Then CPU returns to where it left off in the previous program

## I/O Goals
* **Device independence** - programs can access any device without needing to specify it beforehand
* **Uniform naming** - name of a device should be independent from the device itself
* **Error handling** - errors handled as close to hardware as possible
* **Synchronous VS asynchronous** - ideally you can use both models
* **Buffering** - better for performance
* **Sharable vs dedicated devices** - some things need to be shared, some can't be

## Different I/O implementations

### Programmed I/O
* CPU continuously polls device to see if it's ready to transfer the data
* *Pro* - it's simple
* *Con* - CPU is busy until I/O ends, wasting clock cycles

### Event-Driven I/O (Interrupt-driven I/O)
* Use interrupts so the device can send messages to the CPU
* CPU is able to do something else until the device is ready to transfer
* *Pro* - better than programmed I/O
* *Cons* - interrupt happens for every character, and interrupt takes time, so cycles are still wasted

### I/O Using DMA
* DMA, using a combination of programmed and interrupt-driven I/O
* CPU commands the operation, DMA does the transfer, DMA sends a single interrupt to the CPU when the transfer is complete
* *The best way to do I/O transfer*
