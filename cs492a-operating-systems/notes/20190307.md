# Synchronization Problems Part 2

## Strategies for deadlock
* Allow it to happen
  * Ostrich algorithm - totally ignore it
    * This is what most OSes do - it is the responsibility of the application     developer to prevent deadlock from happening
  * Detect & recover
    * Take snapshots of the program, figure out when a deadlock happens and break it up somehow
* Ensure that it never occurs
  * Avoidance - careful resource allocation - allocation is denied if it might cause a deadlock
  * Prevention

### Deadlock Avoidance

#### Assumptions
* Processes declare resource usage upfront, with maximum usage values
* Processes proceed to completion

#### Trajectories
* When everything about a process is known
* Axes show the time for each of two processes
  * Units of measurement are discrete instruction steps
* Lines can be draw to show in what instruction ranges the resources are used, and boxes where both processes are using the resource represent a deadlock
  * An **unsafe region** is an area from which there is no way to avoid deadlock
    * You're in an unsafe region if you cannot move up or right without running into a deadlock region
* Trajectory lines are only every horizontal or vertical because only one can ever really progress at a time
  * A diagonal trajectory would require parallel execution

#### Goals
* Ensure that a system will never reach an **unsafe state**, from which it has a potential of running into deadlock
* If granting a resource could lead to a deadlock the resource is not granted
