## Process-to-OS Communication
* **System calls**
* Switches execution context from application code (user space) to OS code (kernel space)
* A system call is like a special kind of procedure/function call
  * Basically the app is asking the OS to do something on it's behalf

## OS-to-Process Communication
* **Signals**
* A way for the OS to inform the process about something and ask the process to do something based on the info
* A *segmentation fault* is a signal where the OS is saying that the application is trying to access a memory space that it doesn't have access to

## Threads
Threads live inside a process, and share the same memory, but with their own stack/registers

### Process limitations
* Not very efficient - lots of overhead
* Don't directly share memory with other processes
* Communication is difficult between processes (IPC Inter-Process Communication)
* Thread creation 10-100x faster than process creation
* A process cannot be split across different CPUs

| Per process | Per thread
| :-: | :-: |
| Address space | Program counter |
| Global variables | Registers |
| Open files | Stack |
| Child processes | State |
| Pending alarms | |
| Signals/handlers | |
| Accounting info | |

### Example - word processor
Three threads
* One to handle keyboard input
* One to format the document
* One to write the document to disk

### Example - web server
One thread per request, allows multiple requests to be handled at once
