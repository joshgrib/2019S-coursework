## Problem 1
**Does the busy waiting solution using the turn variable (Fig. 2-23 in the book) work when two processes are running on a shared-memory multiprocessor, that is, two CPUs sharing a common memory?**

Answer

## Problem 2
**Does Petersonâ€™s solution to the mutual-exclusion problem shown in Fig. 2-24 in the book work when process scheduling is preemptive? How about when it is nonpreemptive?**

Answer

## Problem 3
**Five batch jobs. A through E, arrive at a computer center at almost the same time. They have estimated running times of 10, 6, 2, 4, and 8 minutes. Their (externally determined) priorities are 3, 5, 2, 1, and 4, respectively, with 5 being the highest priority. For each of the following scheduling algorithms, determine the mean process turnaround time. Ignore process switching overhead.**
  * **a) Round robin**
  * **b) Priority scheduling**
  * **c) First-come, first-served (run in order 10, 6, 2, 4, 8)**
  * **d) Shortest job first**

**For (a), assume that the system is multiprogrammed, and that each job gets its fair share of the CPU. For (b) through (d), assume that only one job at a time runs, until it finishes. All jobs are completely CPU bound.**

Answer

## Problem 4
**A soft real-time system has four periodic events with periods of 50, 100, 200, and 250 msec each. Suppose that the four events require 35, 20, 10, and $x$ msec of CPU time, respectively. What is the largest value of $x$ for which the system is schedulable?**

Answer

## Problem 5
**Consider the following state of a system with four processes, P1, P2, P3, and P4, and five types of resources, RS1, RS2, RS3, RS4, and RS5:**

**Using the deadlock detection algorithm described in Section 6.4.2, show that there is a deadlock in the system. Identify the processes that are deadlocked.**
