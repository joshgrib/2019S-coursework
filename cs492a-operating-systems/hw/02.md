## Problem 1
**Does the busy waiting solution using the turn variable (Fig. 2-23 in the book) work when two processes are running on a shared-memory multiprocessor, that is, two CPUs sharing a common memory?**

Yes, it will work but there will still be busy waiting ocurring

## Problem 2
**Does Petersonâ€™s solution to the mutual-exclusion problem shown in Fig. 2-24 in the book work when process scheduling is preemptive? How about when it is nonpreemptive?**

Yes, it works in the preemptive case, but in the non-preemptive case is has the potential to fail

## Problem 3
**Five batch jobs. A through E, arrive at a computer center at almost the same time. They have estimated running times of 10, 6, 2, 4, and 8 minutes. Their (externally determined) priorities are 3, 5, 2, 1, and 4, respectively, with 5 being the highest priority. For each of the following scheduling algorithms, determine the mean process turnaround time. Ignore process switching overhead.**
  * **a) Round robin**
  * **b) Priority scheduling**
  * **c) First-come, first-served (run in order 10, 6, 2, 4, 8)**
  * **d) Shortest job first**

**For (a), assume that the system is multiprogrammed, and that each job gets its fair share of the CPU. For (b) through (d), assume that only one job at a time runs, until it finishes. All jobs are completely CPU bound.**

| Process | Runtime | Priority |
| :-:     | :-:     | :-:      |
| A       | 10      | 3        |
| B       | 6       | 5        |
| C       | 2       | 2        |
| D       | 4       | 1        |
| E       | 8       | 4        |

### Priority Scheduling
With priority scheduling the order of executive will be D=>C=>A=>E=>B, with turnaround times:
| Process | Wait time | Execution time | Total |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| D | 0 | 4 | 4 |
| C | 4 | 2 | 6 |
| A | 6 | 10 | 16 |
| E | 16 | 8 | 24 |
| B | 24 | 6 | 30 |

$$\mu_{turnaround} = \frac{4+6+16+24+30}{5} = 16$$

### First-Come First-Served

| Process | Wait time | Execution time | Total |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| A | 0 | 10 | 10 |
| B | 10 | 6 | 16 |
| C | 16 | 2 | 18 |
| D | 18 | 4 | 22 |
| E | 22 | 8 | 30 |

$$\mu_{turnaround} = \frac{10+16+18+22+30}{5} = \frac{96}{5} = 19.2 $$

### Shortest Job First
| Process | Wait time | Execution time | Total |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| C | 0 | 2 | 2 |
| D | 2 | 4 | 6 |
| B | 6 | 6 | 12 |
| E | 12 | 8 | 20 |
| A | 20 | 10 | 30 |

$$\mu_{turnaround} = \frac{2+6+12+20+30}{5} =  14$$

## Problem 4
**A soft real-time system has four periodic events with periods of 50, 100, 200, and 250 msec each. Suppose that the four events require 35, 20, 10, and $x$ msec of CPU time, respectively. What is the largest value of $x$ for which the system is schedulable?**
$$
\frac{35}{50} +
\frac{20}{100} +
\frac{10}{200} +
\frac{x}{250} < 1
$$
$$ x < \frac{25}{2} $$

The largest value to $x$ to still be scheduleable is 12.5

## Problem 5
**Consider the following state of a system with four processes, P1, P2, P3, and P4, and five types of resources, RS1, RS2, RS3, RS4, and RS5:**

**Using the deadlock detection algorithm described in Section 6.4.2, show that there is a deadlock in the system. Identify the processes that are deadlocked.**
