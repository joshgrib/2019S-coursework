# Final Project - Chat App

This project uses a Firebase backend. The authentication info is provided through a `GoogleService-info.plist` file that is created through the Firebase web console during project setup. This one is included so the project can be built to test submissions, but for any other purposes you should run go through the project setup to generate your own file.
